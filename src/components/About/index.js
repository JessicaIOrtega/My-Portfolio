                <br></br>
                Recently, I've been expanding my skill set into Full Stack Development, and I have knowledge of various technologies, including JavaScript, MEARN apps, React, Node, and others. I'm excited about the possibilities that this new area of expertise brings and look forward to using my design background to create beautiful and functional web applications.
